# 🏭 Agentic Factoria

Welcome to **Agentic Factoria** — a global initiative reimagining industrial automation through AI-native, multi-agent systems. We are building the future of intelligent factories: zero downtime, zero waste, zero distance between ideas and execution.

## 🌌 Vision

To orchestrate the world's most intelligent and adaptive manufacturing networks, where autonomous agents collaborate to optimize production, reduce latency, and learn in real-time from every action.

## 🧠 What We’re Building

Agentic Factoria develops **AI-driven agents** that operate every layer of a smart factory:

- 🔧 **Line Commander Agents** – control AGVs, conveyors, and stations with localized optimization
- 👑 **Supervisor Agents** – manage global KPIs, cross-line coordination, and task allocation
- 📦 **Warehouse & Logistics Agents** – coordinate material flow, inventory, and routing
- 🧩 **Marketplace of Agents** – plug-and-play system for upgrading or swapping individual agent roles
- 🌐 **Simulated Testbeds** – built using SimPy and Unity for rapid iteration in virtual factories

All agents communicate via a standardized **MQTT message bus**, and decisions are powered by a modular LLM+Rule engine stack.
